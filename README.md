# Orion Platform

DOCUMENTATION  https://orion-search.readthedocs.io

<br>
Orion Platform is a comprehensive, web-based solution that combines the functionality of a browser, search engine, crawler, and data aggregation tools to empower OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) experts. Built on top of Docker, Orion provides a user-friendly interface to explore, search, and visualize data extracted by its powerful Orion Crawler.<br><br>

The platform integrates seamlessly with machine learning models, enhancing search relevance and enabling advanced
content analysis. Orion supports a broad range of functionalities, including the ability to search, filter, and
visualize data across multiple categories, making it an invaluable tool for data exploration and intelligence
gathering.<br>

Designed with flexibility and scalability in mind, Orion enables OSINT experts to feed data directly into the platform,
ensuring up-to-date and comprehensive datasets. Whether for investigative research, competitive analysis, or general
information gathering, Orion provides a unified ecosystem that enhances the workflow of professionals who rely on
actionable insights.<br>
